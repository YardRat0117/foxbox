# foxbox

A lightweight CLI tool to run common development tools in containers. No need to install compilers locally â€” you can just use `foxbox` and run commands in isolated containers.

---

## Features

- Run tools in containers with a single command
- Auto-mount directory into the container
- Supports Podman (Docker support coming later)

---

## Installation

1. Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yardrat0117/foxbox.git
cd foxbox
./build.sh
```

2. Prepare Podman (e.g., via APT)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install podman
```

3. Ready to use!

---

## Usage

1. List all configured tools

```bash
foxbox list
```

2. Install a configured tool

```bash
foxbox install gcc
foxbox install python@3.12
```

3. Run a specified tool

```bash
foxbox run gcc -- hello.c -o hello
foxbox run python@3.12 -- hello.py
```

4. Remove a specified tool
```bash
foxbox remove gcc
foxbox remove python@3.12
```


5. Check version

```bash
foxbox version
```

---

## Configuration

Default tools are provided in `config/default.yml`. 
You can also DIY - if `~/.config/foxbox.yml` is provided, this would override `config/default.yml`.
Note: `$(pwd)` is the supported representation for current working directory in `foxbox.yml`. Please adhere to this represetation!
